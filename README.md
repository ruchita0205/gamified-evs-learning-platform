# EcoPlay: Gamified EVS Learning Platform 🎮🌍

This repository contains the **student-facing game app** for our SIH 2025 project.

## Current Status
🚧 **Work in Progress**  
- Building a storyline-driven RPG is heavy and cannot be completed in a single month.  
- Current version includes **core mechanics and demo levels** to showcase key features.  
- Future versions will expand with full storyline missions and additional environmental challenges.  

## Features (Planned + Demoed)
- ✅ Primary level: Mini-games teaching eco-friendly habits (waste sorting, water saving).  
- ✅ Secondary level (RPG): Early stage map + mission framework.  
- ⏳ Storyline expansion, more levels, and advanced challenges coming soon.  

## Why This Project?
We believe environmental awareness must start early. By combining **gamification + data tracking**, EcoPlay helps build eco-conscious students while enabling teachers to measure real impact.  

## Teacher App
The companion **Teacher Dashboard** was built using a **Low Code/No Code (LCNC) platform** — inspired by our current semester course.  
It allows teachers to:
- Track logins & engagement
- View eco-awareness progress
- Generate class-wide reports
